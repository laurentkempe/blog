I am working lately on some performance optimization and when you do so you need to measure things. For that kind of goals, [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) is fantastic.
So, one side I had BenchmarkDotNet and on the other my test assembly already containing some great infrastructure to build complex arrange which would put my system in the state I want to measure performance against.
How could I match those two goals?

The issue is that the test assemblies are not executables and 

I leveraged the possibility to have 

# TODO

  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <StartupObject>MyApplication.Core.Program</StartupObject>
  </PropertyGroup>
