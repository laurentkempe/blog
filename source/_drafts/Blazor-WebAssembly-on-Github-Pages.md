Microsoft [Build 2020](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222020-05-19T00%253A00%253A00%252B02%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222020-05-21T23%253A59%253A00%252B02%253A00%2522%257D) was held this week, and the .NET team released **[Blazor WebAssembly](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-now-available/)**! Two weeks before the event, I started to have a look to [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), especially the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) version of it. Before that, I just read about Blazor and had only a high level view on it, but never used it.

# Goals

I want to see, if in a short time I could create a minimum Blazor 'application', debug it then configure a build pipeline leveraging [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and host the application on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Saying, a minimum Blazor 'application', means using .NET CLI template, add a 3rd party ui components library and add a page with some of those components.

# Tooling

I want to start light so I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I had already the C# extension installed so I had to install the JavaScript Debugger extension, see [the documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio-code). I also installed the project template, which I think is not needed anymore to install manually, is you install the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

# Creating project

    â–¶ dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp
    â–¶ cd BlazorApp
    â–¶ dotnet run

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ You have an 'application' running!

ADD SCREENSHOT

# Debugging

 [Learn more and enable it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/debug?tabs=visual-studio-code&view=aspnetcore-3.1#vscode) in Visual Code settings of the extension.

Put a breakpoint in the *IncrementCount()* method in the page *Counter.razor*.

To hit a break point, you need to launch the app with the two launchers created ".NET Core Launch (Blazor Standalone)" then ".NET Core Debug Blazor Web Assembly in Chrome"

# Add new page with 3rd party ui components

Modifying a little bit the code of the template, let me enter slowly into how Blazor works. So, I searched some 3rd party libraries and found several ones but at the end decided to go with [Radzen Blazor component library](https://blazor.radzen.com/). In fact, it was not really important which one, I just wanted something free to use.

I added to BlazorApp.csproj

     <PackageReference Include="Radzen.Blazor" Version="2.9.2"/>

Then I searched how to add a new page, which was fairly simple and added *RadzenDemo.razor* in *Pages* and created a new menu entry to it in *NavMenu.razor*.

I then browsed a bit deeper the code generated by the Blazor template to get a better understanding. I realized that it was quite similar to some of the things I already have seen with ASP.NET Core and Razor. Then, I followed the [get started page of Radzen](https://blazor.radzen.com/get-started).

# Host on Github Pages

To host the Blazor application during my trial, I created [a docs folder](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-a-repository-for-your-site) and used it to publish the application. At second thought after the experiment, it is better to use [gh-pages branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-a-repository-for-your-site).

 > The default publishing source for a project site is the gh-pages branch. If the repository for your project site has a gh-pages branch, your site will publish automatically from that branch.

 So, with the following command I could publish the application

     â–¶ dotnet publish -c Release

Then, copying the results to the docs folder and made a git push to Github. I for sure then expected to see it working but it did not! I found why on the blog post of [Andrea Cirioni](https://twitter.com/cirio) "[Hosting Blazor WebAssembly app on GitHub Pages](https://dev.to/cirio/hosting-blazor-webassembly-app-on-github-pages-137k)"! So I added the .nojekyll file in the docs folder and replaced the index.html page! And it worked ðŸŽ‰

# Build using Github Actions

Now, that we can publish a Blazor app on Github Pages the next step was to build it with Github Actions, so that on any push on master branch it is built and deployed.

That was straight forward, it needs to setup .NET Core with correct version, install dependencies, build, publish and deploy.

# Conclusion

It took me between two to three hours to have all of this set up and working!
I am impressed by the technology, it has been a long time I hadn't been impressed like that!

The 'application' is available [following this link](https://laurentkempe.com/BlazorApp/).

You can get all the code on GitHub
