I was looking for that moment for long. I am big fan of automation as you might have already recognized if you read my blog in the past.
Today, it is the day in which I could take it to another level. I can start working on .NET projects using my favorites IDE, JetBrains Rider connecting to a remote machine and leveraging the power of that remote machine without even having .NET installed on my machine. And this is possible thanks to Gitpod. Ok, I know you need a network connection.
